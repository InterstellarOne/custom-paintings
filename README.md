# Custom Paintings
A guide on how to create custom paintings with KawaMood's Better Paintings datapack
This datapack uses custom player heads in block displays to easily display any texture, which makes custom paintings fairly easy to add, without overriding defaults and with no resource packs.

## Understanding the templates
This guide includes skin templates for creating custom paintings, and it is important to understand how to use them. 

Each skin, excluding 1x1s, holds four 8x8 tiles pulled from the painting. 
I will be using "painting tile" throughout this guide to refer to 8x8 squares copied from the painting, and I will refer to 8x8 squares of the skins as a "tile"

Each of these tiles is marked by a yellow dotted outline, and the red square on each represents which painting tile you should copy on top of it. For example, the left-most tile has the red square in the top left corner, so you would copy the top left 8x8 painting tile, and paste it on the tile in the skin. 

Be aware, these tiles can be rotated, so the red square indicates the direction that the tile is oriented, with the darker part facing upwards.

The final element that can appear in these templates is the double-sided arrow, which is the symbol for flipping the tile in the direction of the arrows. **↔** is horizontal, **↕** is vertical.
